Reference Wiki
===============

Sometimes we need to remember a specific command, or use an uncommon tool, and digging through tons of manpages, documentation and stack overflow pages every time is quite troublesome and tiring, specially if it isn't very well documented or is just very complex.

So, this repo has my thoughts, learnings or just things that I can forget and probably will use in the future.
Everything starts at [index.wiki](/index.wiki) and every topic is at one or more files.

Usage
======

This repo is specially crafted to be used at Vim with [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki).
But it can be used without it also.
